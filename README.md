**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**Header**
I enjoy this simple, to the point design. I would either add curved arrows to either side of "Around", or even varying shapes to border the sides of the header image in the shapes of continents, each outlined in black to match the background/have a good seperation between them. As for the border at the bottom, I would have the border dotted with an X at the end, and maybe even a small picture of an airplane at the beginning/along the dotted line.

**Profile**
This section was the most challenging for me due to all of the elements fitting together enough to show the profile name and to center the round profile image. I would add a border undet the profile title(name), because I think that would pull this section together nicely.

**Cards**
This part of the project is very pleasing to the eye, I like how the pictures are shown before the title and the little like button as well. I wouldn't add much to these cards, just a pulsating animation when hovered over, and clicked!

**Footer**
The footer is the only part of the project where I felt a lot could be added to it to make this part more appealing, even though the copyright wouldn't need anything fancy. I think that a small png picture of a planet in the right-hand side or even after the "U.S" would make the footer more memorable and fun to look at.

**Summary of Experience**
This has been the most difficult project yet, this experience makes me anxious for future projects, but also immensely excited to learn new skills! Thank you to the TripleTen team for guiding and helping me through this!
