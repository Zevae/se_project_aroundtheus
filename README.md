## Overview

**Around the U.S.**

This project demonstrates a responsive and modular design, ensuring a seamless user experience across a diverse range of screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop monitors. Scalability and accessibility make the interface intuitive and user-friendly.

Key functionalities include interactive and modular button components, which provide efficient user interactions for actions such as liking cards, editing the user profile, and adding new content.

Additionally, the user profile section focuses on customization and personalization. Users can edit their profiles, with input validations in place to ensure consistent and meaningful updates.

By blending responsive design, modular interactivity, and customizable features, this website showcases robust and reliable code.

## Design Insights

### Header
The header design is simple and direct. Decorative curved arrows on either side of the title or subtle continent-shaped borders could enhance the "world" theme.

### Profile
This section was the most challenging for me due to all of the elements fitting together to display the profile name and center the round profile image. Adding a solid line beneath the profile image and description could create a clean break and cohesive appearance.

### Cards
The card layout is visually appealing. A hover animation with a pulsating effect could make the interaction more engaging.

### Footer
The footer could be enhanced with a small planet icon beside the copyright text or after "U.S." to add charm and memorability.
